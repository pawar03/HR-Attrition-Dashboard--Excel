# HR Attrition Dashboard

## Project Overview
The HR Attrition Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive view of employee attrition within an organization. This dashboard helps HR professionals and management understand the factors contributing to employee turnover, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention. The dashboard displays various metrics such as total attrition, attrition by job role, education level, age group, gender, and more.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project contains detailed records of employees, including their demographic information, job roles, education levels, travel frequency, performance status, and attrition status. This data is crucial for analyzing different dimensions of employee turnover and identifying key factors affecting attrition rates.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Importing the HR data into Excel Power Query, removing unwanted columns, and transforming the data for analysis.
2. **Dashboard Design**: Setting up the dashboard canvas, adding shapes and visual elements, and organizing the layout for intuitive navigation.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating various charts and graphs to visualize attrition by job role, education level, age group, gender, and other factors.
4. **Interactive Features**: Adding slicers and filters for gender and department to enable users to interact with the dashboard and view specific subsets of data.
5. **Final Formatting**: Ensuring all elements are properly formatted and the dashboard is user-friendly and visually appealing.
